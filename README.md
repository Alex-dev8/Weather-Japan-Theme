# Weather-Japan-Theme
A weather app using OpenWeather API. You will need to go into the Constants folder and insert your own API key for the API call to work.
The app has a very simple UI, and the API is calling more items than the app can currently display. So it's up to you to choose which ones to display and how.
The background is photo from Japan, which can of course be replaces with anything you like.
The app uses Core Location, as well as protocols and delegates already in place for the WeatherModel to work correctly in the view controller.
